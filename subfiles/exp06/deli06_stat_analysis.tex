%- accuracy of the arm
%- does the distribution of the object follow gaussian distribution?
%- how change in shape and mass affect the accuracy and precision, is it statistically significant?
%- how much the change of the placing pose (L - R - S) affect the accuracy and precision, is it statistically significant?
%- which of the above mentioned factors(change in object vs change in placing pose) has the most significant effect on the accuracy and precision?

To find the accuracy and precision of the youBot robot arm, the gathered data has to be further analyzed. First outliers were removed using
