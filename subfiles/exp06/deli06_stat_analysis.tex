To find the accuracy, the mean of the point clouds for each direction and object was compared with its respective ground truth. For precision, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted (using only the X and Y coordinates of the data), and the largest standard deviation was used to describe the (worst-case) precision.
The results of this analysis are depicted in Tables \ref{tab:acc_prec_opti} and \ref{tab:acc_prec_rob}. These tables reveal that accuracy and precision is primarily influenced by the direction of motion, while object size mainly impacts precision.
Regarding accuracy, both the OptiTrack system and the youBot Arm show that the left direction is generally the least accurate. For the OptiTrack system, the straight direction exhibits the highest accuracy, while for the youBot Arm, the right direction provides the highest accuracy. Additionally, for the OptiTrack system, the large object size is generally more accurate, whereas object size has a minimal effect on the youBot Arm's accuracy.
For precision, the OptiTrack system shows that the large object generally has the highest precision, while the small object is the least precise (except in the right direction). For the youBot Arm, the medium object generally has the highest precision, and the large object has the lowest precision (except in the straight direction).
