\subsection*{Usage of AI Assistants}
In this work the AI Assistants, Gemini 2.5 Flash and ChatGPT 5, were used to help with Latex and Python code generation (e. g. turning multiple figures into one, plotting),
as well as help with sentence structure, formulation and grammar.

\subsection*{Raw Data and Software}
All of the raw data and code/software we used is in our repository at \href{https://github.com/FHuppertz/SEE_WS2025}{\nolinkurl{https://github.com/FHuppertz/SEE_WS2025}}.
