When analyzing the data with respect to the executed motions (left, straight, right), we consider both the accuracy and precision. We can consider the accuracy by seeing how much the manual measurements deviate from the encoder data, and we can consider the 
precision by seeing how spread out and dispersed the manual measurements are.
