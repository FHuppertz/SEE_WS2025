%5. Describe the images poses used for calibration and report the found camera parameters including any error estimates (where applicable)

Figures \ref{fig:left} to \ref{fig:right} depict the end points of the mass and the end effector and compares them to the given ground truth for each. These figures show that the experiment setup has a very large systematic error, leading to very low accuracy. The precision appears to be high except for the small mass. It is important to note that the orientation of the mass are not shown, due to misalignment of the object during placement back to the start position by a human. Also outlier were removed using Chebyshev twice, were everything out of two sigma was discarded as an outlier.
