% TODO: Describe what happened during your 225 runs here.

During the execution of the 225 trials (25 repetitions per configuration), several observations were made that are relevant to the data analysis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The OptiTrack system would be unable to detect the object, if one of the markers was blocked. We made sure that did not happend during trials.
    \item The rosbag creation was faulty sometimes, and these trials had to be redone.
    \item The larger the opbject, the longer it took to settle down and no longer oscillate.
\end{itemize}
