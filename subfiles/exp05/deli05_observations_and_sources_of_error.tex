\subsection{Observations and Sources of Error}
% TODO: Describe what happened during your 225 runs here.

During the execution of the 225 trials (25 repetitions per configuration), several observations were made that are relevant to the data analysis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lighting Conditions:} % TODO: Did the lighting change? Did you close curtains as requested in[cite: 218]? 
    We ensured the lab curtains were closed to maintain uniform lighting for the OptiTrack markers.
    
    \item \textbf{Vibration and Stability:} % TODO: Did the table shake? [cite: 221] warns about shaking affecting camera measurement.
    We made sure not to shake the table to the maximum extent when the experiment was running. Althouhggh minor vibrations were inevitable, they were kept minimal.
    
    \item \textbf{Marker Placement:} % TODO: Did the markers on the blocks stay secure?
    The markers on the objects were securely attached and checked periodically to ensure they did not shift during the trials.
    
    \item \textbf{Robot Behavior:} % TODO: Did the robot shudder or make noise in specific poses?
    The robot performed smoothly in most poses, but occasional minor shudders were observed, particularly when transitioning to the Left pose.
    
    \item \textbf{Emergency Stops:} % TODO: Did you have to use the green button? 
    There were no instances where the emergency stop button was required during the trials.
