During the experiment our team has made the following observations:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The robot jerks at the beginning of a run, which leads to an unpredictable jump forward
	\item The used pens are not great for marking and needed to be repeatetly tapped on the paper to make a mark
	\item Due to the large number of points close together, that need to be measured, a system of crossing out past points needed to be developed
	\item Accidental run starts have happened, which leads to outliers in the encoder data, which were to complicated to remove during the experiment, and had to be left in
\end{itemize}
