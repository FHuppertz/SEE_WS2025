Figure \ref{fig:all_pose_plot} depicts the combined pen measured end poses of the robot of all four teams.
Figures \ref{fig:team1_end_pose} to \ref{fig:team4_end_pose} depict the robot end pose, calculated from the manual measurements, as well as the robots trajectory, calculated from the encoder data for each team.
