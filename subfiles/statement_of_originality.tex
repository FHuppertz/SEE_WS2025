\section*{STATEMENT OF ORIGINALITY}
\noindent We, the undersigned below, declare that this work has not previously been submitted to this or any other university and that it is, unless otherwise stated, entirely our own work. The report was, in part, written with the help of the AI assistants Gemini and ChatGPT as described in the appendix. We are aware that content generated by AI systems is no substitute for careful scientific work, which is why all AI-generated content has been critically reviewed by us, and we take full responsibility for it.
